            <h2>My Design Manifesto</h2>
            <p>In reflecting on all my past design experiences, I found myself gradually figuring out my own design philosophy that keeps me on the right track. My design process was initially guided by the different design stages I learned in Dr. Wall's HCI class, like Needfinding, Defining problems, Prototyping, and Heuristic Evaluation. These ideas were very helpful at the beginning stage of my design experience. They gave me a general direction on how I could proceed with my design process when I am lost. 
                Most of my earlier design work was following the stages. </p>
            <p>Later on, we learned the Five Sheet Methodology, and this methodology 
                became a useful template for me to record and finalize my design ideas.”</p>
            <p>As I was following all the guidelines I learned in class and spent more time in designing, I was also slowly forming my own design philosophy. 
                There are mainly five points in my design manifesto, and I will introduce them here.</p>

            <h4>Be Ambitious</h4>
            <p>The first thing I found very important is the mindset even before starting the design process, that is, being ambitious. Having a larger scope at the beginning always enables me and my team members to be more creative. Don't limit your imagination and leave regrets at the end thinking 'what we could have done.' Although sometimes being too ambitious at the beginning might bring extra pressure, I take it as a great opportunity to learn something new and challenge my limitation. I think the reason all my teammates 
                and I could gain so much throughout the design process is that we kept setting high goals and challenged ourselves.</p>
            
            <p>In the design for understanding assignment, our team made an interactive webpage visualizing the wealth of Elon Musk. We were surprised that we could successfully implement our idea given the limited time. It would be easier just to make some plots to visualize the data, but we wanted our visualization to stand out and make an impact. Inspired by some previous work, we decided to make the visualization more interactive and accessible by hosting a website. However, we only have limited experience in web development, and the deadline was close. Our potential was fully realized under the pressure. We started the implementation along with learning new techniques. We were finally able to publish the website a few hours before the presentation.

            </p>

            <h4>Needfinding</h4>
            <p>
                This was the first thing I learned in the HCI class, and I take it as one of the most important stages in my design process. All the greatest design solves some of the people's needs.
Also, need-finding is the most important way of generating new ideas for me. Most of my design projects' ideas came up after discovering users' needs. During the airport guidance app design, I initially intended to design something that helps people find the uber pickup location. After interviewing people, I figured out that there is a more general need for airport navigation services. Therefore, my final design was an airport indoor navigation app, which was highly rated by professors and peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the mobile app webpage design, our team was stuck at the brainstorming stage. We were designing the Atlanta History Center's webpage for visiting medical researchers, and we had a hard time figuring out what we should put into the webpage. Later on, we figured out there is a need for schedule arrangements among visiting researchers since their schedules are mostly pretty busy. We then decided to improve the event listing page to emphasize each event's date. It was this kind of detail that improves our user experience, and need-finding is always the best way to help us determine what we should design.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Collaboration
            </h4>
            <p>
                Designers never work alone. This is what I realized by working on a number of projects in this class. Collaboration is an important component of a good design because a meaningful product requires synthesized perspectives and ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the brainstorming stage, I found it useful to share my ideations with my groupmates. Receiving feedback from them helps me to formulate a better idea based on what I already have. By looking at others' ideas, I can also realize the flaws in my own ideas. Bouncing ideas off each other has helped me to create initial ideas with more comprehensive perspectives, which is an important foundation for a design solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the implementation stage, collaboration is also crucial. Dividing up the work into parts helped us to create our product in a more efficient way. We were also able to utilize more specialized skills in each part. In the chatbot design project, my group divided the work based on our strengths. I was taking charge of the coding and technique part since I had more experience in Natural Language Processing. Some other teammates with better writing skills were focused on the script generating and presenting. By dividing up the work, our team was able to complete the chatbot efficiently and we had enough time to record a demo video.
            </p>

            <h4>Make a schedule</h4>
            <p>
                In real life, a design project always has a time limit. Having a time-based schedule can make our life much easier later on. I learned this a hard way during the 'design for understanding' project.
            </p>
            <p>
                A part of the 'design for understanding' project was to deliver the data in an impactful way to let people understand something new. We had around two weeks to deliver our final prototype. However, we started the implementation five days before the deadline because we spent too much time coming up with the most creative idea possible. We overlooked the fact that implementing our idea into a real product also takes time. In the end, we had to stay up all night to finish the product by the deadline and didn't have much time to prepare for the final presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience helped me realize that as a designer, taking time into consideration is also an important skill. Instead of coming up with ideas in our head, it is more important to divide the project into parts and make a plan in order to complete the project in a more timely manner.

            </p>
            <h4>Less is More</h4>
            <p>
                Throughout the HCI class, I've seen a lot of good and bad design examples. I found one common thing between many of the bad designs - trying to present too much information. For website or app design, some designer tries present as many features as possible to users, but it often makes the interface cluttered and takes users more time to absorb.
Having the idea 'Less is More' helps us to extract the core features of a design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comparing the above two web pages, while apple's website leaves a huge amount of blank space and presents very little information, we could perceive everything easily. However, although IMDb's webpage listed more information within one page, we are actually absorbing less information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea 'less is more' always leads us to a cleaner design with a focus on the core features. When we are designing Airscope (a wireless headphone for museum guidance), the initial prototype was a stethoscope liked headphone with a retractable wire and a touch screen. We were thinking that having the retractable feature would make the product fancier. However, the retractable design made the product heavier and the wires were easily tangled. Also, this was not the product's main feature but the retractable part draw the user's attention away. Having the idea less is more, we decided to completely delete the retractable function and switched to Bluetooth connection. This simple change made the design much cleaner and user-friendly.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                
Overall, I am still in the beginning stage of my design experience. My design philosophy is not perfect right now and will never be perfect. I will keep reflecting on my future design project and develop my understanding of design.
